basic turn loop
    add live ants
    remove dead ants
    update orders
        issue orders to all ants in idle set.
            destroying enemy hills takes highest priority
                if an enemy hill has been found send all idle ants to destroy
            food is next
                assign ants to gather food until all food is has been removed from the list
            exploring the map is last
                assign remaining idle ants to closest (random?) unseen tile
    do orders
        for all ants
            if the orders are empty
            pop the next order off the stack
            if that location is passible
                push the next simple order onto the stack
            else call A* and re-issue orders
            perform order
            if the order queue is empty remove the ant from it's current set and add it to the idle set

    perform map analytics
        get choke points
        find symetry
